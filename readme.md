# JavaScriptmas Day 14 - Lonely Elf

My effort for [Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas2021) Day 14 challenge.

The main task was to:

- Write a function to duplicate the elf when the button is clicked.

I also put the elves in 6 column grid layout and included a fade in animation for each elf, because that's what elves like üßù
